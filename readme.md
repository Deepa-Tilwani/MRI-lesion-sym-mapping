Abstract : 


Decades of research have been devoted to understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of language impairment following brain
damage due to stroke. Traditionally, the study of language deficits in lesion-symptom mapping investigations has relied on mass
univariate statistics, which do not consider complex, multidimensional relationships between variables. It is therefore possible that
advanced machine learning (ML) techniques could better predict post-stroke language outcome measures and provide new insights
about the neuroanatomical bases of language production and comprehension. Here, we developed an advanced ML pipeline to
predict the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) from the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) scores using
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large cohort of stroke survivors in the chronic stage
